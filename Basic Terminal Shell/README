The zip folder contains the source file Phase3.c, which is a composition of the phase1 & phase2 parts.
Run gcc -Wall -o proj1 Phase3.c  --- To create the executable proj1
PHASE 1
For this part of the assignment, program should be run with desired commands next to executable file. (Caution: if the program is run without commands it will behave exactly like a shell terminal - which is the Phase2 portion of the assignment.)
In order to run this section of the code, I made sure the command line argument count is greater than 1. 
PHASE 2
In phase 2, the program should be executed without arguments. It will prompt user to input a command to execute. I implemented this in a loop where my shell terminal only exits back into the original terminal when the exit command is run. 
For set prompt command, the command should follow the syntax as described in the assignment instruction(set prompt =  NEW PROMPT). 
TEST CASES
The test cases contains the terminal outputs of various commands which I run.
